Basically I want to do something like http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/ 
and http://www.martingrandjean.ch/network-visualization-shakespeare/ but with lord of the rings movies. 
Found an easy to parse version of the script at http://www.ageofthering.com/atthemovies/scripts/
so using that at the moment

ideas/questions:

- network connections between characters
- character occurence
- potentially at some point compare movie with the books...?
(possibly from http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_1__en.htm)
- scenes with only 1 character?
- are there many scenes with lots of voice overs?
